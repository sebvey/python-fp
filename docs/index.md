Since Python 3.0 `map`, `filter` & co (but more accurately even since Python 2 list comprehension), new versions of the language keep appending more and more functional elements, last in date being Generics, Union typing or Pattern Matching.  
However although functional programming in its roughest form is possible in Python, it fails in our opinion to keep itself nice and readable.
```python
# Look this awful little chunk of code, how cute it is <3

initial_value = ["oh", "look", "an", "array", "to", "process", "!"]
camel_cased = map(lambda chain: [chain[0].upper()] + chain[1:], initial_value)
only_long_word = filter(lambda x: len(x) > 2, camel_cased)
output = reduce(lambda x, y: x + " " + y, only_long_word)

assert output == "Look Array Process"
```

This project aims to soften the functional syntax already existing within the language, and go even further by enabling more functional concepts.
